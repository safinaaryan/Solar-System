    <h3 class="title"> Earth: Our Home Planet</h3>
     <p class="para">
        Earth is a very special planet. It’s the only one we know of where people, animals, and plants can live. That’s why we call it our “home planet.” Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and it’s just the right distance to not be too hot or too cold. It’s like the “Goldilocks” planet—not too big, not too small, but just right!

One of the coolest things about Earth is that it has land, air, and water. About 70% of Earth’s surface is covered with water—oceans, lakes, and rivers. That’s why Earth looks mostly blue when you see pictures of it from space. The land gives us places to live, grow food, and explore. The air is full of oxygen, which people and animals need to breathe. All of these things work together to make life possible.

Earth spins like a top, which gives us day and night. It takes 24 hours to make one full spin. When your part of the Earth faces the Sun, it’s daytime. When your part turns away from the Sun, it’s nighttime. Earth also travels around the Sun once every year. This trip around the Sun is what causes the seasons—spring, summer, fall, and winter. When your part of the Earth tilts toward the Sun, it gets warmer, and that’s summer. When it tilts away, it gets colder, and that’s winter!

Earth is shaped like a ball, but it’s not perfectly round. It’s a little bit squished at the top and bottom. Earth has a strong force called gravity, which keeps everything on the ground—including you! That’s why we don’t float away into space.

<p class="para">
There are seven large pieces of land on Earth called continents: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. People live all over the world in different countries, speaking different languages and living in different ways. Even though we’re all different, we share the same planet.

Earth is also full of amazing nature—tall mountains, deep oceans, wide forests, dry deserts, and icy places near the poles. Animals of all shapes and sizes live here, from tiny ants to giant whales. Plants grow in every corner, giving us food and fresh air.

It’s important to take care of Earth. That means keeping it clean, saving water, and protecting nature. After all, we only have one Earth—and it’s our beautiful home!
