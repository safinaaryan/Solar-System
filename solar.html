    <p class="para">The Solar System is a huge space neighborhood where we live. It includes the Sun, eight planets, many moons, and other space objects like asteroids,
         comets, and dwarf planets. Everything in the Solar System moves around the Sun, which sits in the center like the leader of a cosmic dance.

    <p class="para">
The Sun is a giant star made of very hot gases. It gives us light and heat, and its strong gravity keeps all the planets from floating away into space. Gravity is 
like an invisible rope that pulls things toward each other.

   <p class="para">
There are eight planets in our Solar System. Starting from the Sun, they are:
Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.

Each planet is special in its own way. Earth is our home and the only planet we know that has life. Jupiter is the biggest planet — it’s so big that more than 1,000 Earths
 could fit inside it! Saturn is famous for its beautiful rings, and Mars is called the “Red Planet” because of its color.

Some planets have moons that go around them. Earth has one moon, but Jupiter has over 90! There are also asteroids (rocky space objects) and comets (icy objects that 
sometimes grow tails when they get close to the Sun).

 <p class="para">
Way out past Neptune, there’s a region called the Kuiper Belt where you can find dwarf planets like Pluto. These are smaller than the regular planets but still part 
of the Solar System.

The Solar System is huge — so big that it takes years for spacecraft to travel from one planet to another. But even though it’s far and wide, scientists have learned
 a lot by using telescopes and sending space probes to explore.

The Solar System is an amazing and exciting place full of wonders, and it’s right outside our world!</p>
